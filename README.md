# Anomalous Object Detection Using Perception Based Architecture

Anomalies are a tricky subject in image classification. Unlike objects in an image which could be classified into categories such as vehicles, person, etc. we can’t always confine the anomalies in the images to a category. They are dynamic in their occurrence in the nature. Hybrid neural networks can help us overcome the struggle of labelling anomalies in an image. This project aims to use a 2-step neural network algorithm to (a) classify the room by a class (here, class ϵ {bedroom, living, kitchen, bathroom, and game room}), and (b) localize the anomalies in the room. The use case for this project is to assist the ground staff in maintaining the property to restore it to it’s original state post- occupation by guests.
